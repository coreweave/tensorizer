## MkDocs configuration

To install the required packages and serve the documentation locally, run the following commands:

```bash
$ pip install mkdocs \
              mkdocs-material \
              mkdocs-mermaid2-plugin \
              mkdocstrings \
              mkdocstrings[python] \
              mkdocs-gen-files \
              mkdocs-literate-nav \
              mkdocs-section-index
$ mkdocs serve
```

**Optional:** `mkdocstring[python]` can also be installed [as a project dependency](https://mkdocstrings.github.io/python/#installation).
